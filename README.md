data-common
==

A Python library encapsulating functionality for cloud data 
related projects or datalakes.

The library's functionality can be used for orchestration by external frameworks such as Apache-Airflow, 
but will remain <b>independent<b> to facilitate use by other modules and frameworks.  

Architecture will strive to remain functionally flat => exposing atomic functionality independent of encapsulating multi purpose large objects.
